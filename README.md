http://murmurscollective.net

website for murmurs collective based in halifax, ns, canada

#### edits:
the simplest way to edit (on github) is to click on a file and then click the 'edit' pencil icon in the upper right corner to change stuff around, then hit 'commit changes' and the changes will happen relatively instantly on the site itself. (you need to contact me first so i can make you a collaborator.)

#### site structure:

* **artist pages** are in `_posts/artists/`
* **cyphers are in** `_posts/cyphers/`
* **releases** are in `_posts/releases`
* **artist images** are in `artistimgs/`
* **release images** are in `releaseimgs/`
* **main pages** (contact, about, the list of artists, etc) are the `.html` files in the top directory

**if adding new files in the `_posts` folders**, they must follow the naming convention (i.e. with date, even though it is irrelevant in some cases.)
