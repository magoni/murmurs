terminoir, 23 years old, has always had an affinity for lush, beautiful melodies. Classically trained in piano and later violin, his love for composition developed into a passionate affair with soundscapes and harmonies.

<br>
Years later, terminoir now brings us Hush EP, a depiction of the warm tropical vibes found only in the summertime. Infused with sassy R&amp;B vocals and catchy melodies, terminoir has taken the next step in his musical journey and has allowed us to glimpse into his world of smooth soulful vibes.
