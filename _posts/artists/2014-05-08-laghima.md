<p>20 years young producer from Chicago Il. I've been making music for a few years and I'm not sure of what direction going with it, but I'm still growing as an artist. I'm heavily influenced by other producers such as Flying Lotus, 9th Wonder, Yeezy, Lapalux, Dj Rashad, and Frankie Knuckles. Expect great things.</p>
